						<p>
							Sarah Torrey has a Masters in Social Work from Simmons
							School of Social Work and has been working in the
							Providence area for 25 years and in private practice
							since 2008.  Sarah's warm, eclectic style is grounded in
							Psychodynamic and Attachment theories.  After many years
							of varied work with families and children, Sarah’s focus
							is now primarily on adult individual work.</p>
						<p><br>
							Sarah has Psychodynamic, Attachment and Family Systems
							training and has incorporated other approaches over her
							years of practice, including elements of Mindfulness,
							Cognitive Behavior, Acceptance, and Play therapies. Her
							approach is relationship based and present focused, but
							always attends to the relevant past.  She brings a deep
							understanding of attachment to her work with all her
							clients.</p>
						<p><br>Sarah has a continuing interest in perinatal women’s
							health, infant mental health, and attachment theory across
							 the life span.    She is a 2009 graduate of the Infant
							 Mental Health Fellowship at the Infant-Parent Training
							 Institute of Jewish Family & Children’s Service in
							 Waltham, Massachusetts.  Sarah is now on the faculty
							 there, where she teaches Infant Observation.  She does
							 dyadic work with new mothers and their babies, sees
							 toddlers and young children with their families and
							 provides both outpatient and occasional home-based
							 treatment.</p>
						<p><br>
							 Sarah also offers clinical consultation, including via
							 telephone or Skype. </p>

					<p>
					“My curiosity about people's lives, relationships, feelings and the
					way they create meaning is at the heart of my practice in
					psychotherapy. I am deeply interested in the complexities and
					possibilities of family life. As human beings, we all must negotiate
					daily the emotional landscapes of our families, past and present. I
					have been doing that with adults, children and families in various
					capacities for over twenty years.”
				</p><p><br>
					“Seeking help takes both hope and courage. Psychotherapy, with its
					focus on new ways of thinking, being with ourselves and others, and
					experiencing our internal worlds, creates a caring collaboration and
					partnership within which this challenging work can be tackled
					together.  My goal in therapy is to provide you with the structure and
					emotional safety to explore and share what isn’t working in your
					life—your relationships, your parenting, your work or your
					relationship with your body—without judgment.  I believe strongly in
					the capacity of humans to remain open to new experience, in spite of
					what they may have encountered in the world to discourage that habit.
					I believe too that all relationships hold open the possibility for
					connection at a deep level:  feeling seen, feeling heard and
					feeling felt.  It’s what we all long for.”
