						<p class="quattrocento black-text">
							Jeff Migneault is a clinical psychologist who has been providing
							individual psychotherapy in the Providence area for over 20 years.
							He received his doctorate in clinical psychology from the
							University of Rhode Island and completed his clinical internship
							at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.  Jeff does individual adult
							work, from young adults to seniors.</p>
						<p class="quattrocento black-text"><br>
							He uses an eclectic approach to therapy, drawing on his broad
							range of training, and works with his clients to find the best fit
							for each person.  His approach draws on Psychodynamic, Family
							Systems, and Cognitive Behavioral therapies.  He also incorporates
							Mindfulness techniques and ideas, drawing on both formal training
							and many years of personal experience with contemplative practices.
						</p>
						<p class="quattrocento black-text"><br>
							Jeff approaches the work as a collaborative endeavor.  He works
							with adults to address a wide range of issues including anxiety,
							depression, relationship issues, difficulties with unhealthy
							habits or addictions, and life-stage issues.  Although he
							acknowledges the importance of understanding past events and
							experiences, his goal is to make changes in the present that
							allow for a person to be more fully themselves and engaged with
							the people and world around them.
